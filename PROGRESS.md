### Architecture Decisions

**Database-First**
- All state and configuration in SQLite
- No text-based config files
- File-level tracking with hashes for integrity and delta updates

**Conary-Inspired Design**
- Changesets as core primitive (atomic operations)
- Troves as hierarchical package units
- Flavors for build-time variations
- Components for automatic package splitting
- Provenance tracking for supply chain security

**Technology Stack**
- Rust 1.91.1 stable (Edition 2024)
- rusqlite (synchronous SQLite interface)
- File-level granularity for delta updates and rollback

### Next Steps (Phase 5)
**Phase 5: TBD - See ROADMAP.md**
- Dependency resolution system
- Repository management
- Additional package formats (DEB, Arch)
- CLI commands for package operations

### Open Questions
- Delta update implementation strategy (binary diff tools: bsdiff, xdelta3, zstd?)
- Package format parser priority (start with RPM, DEB, or Arch?)
- Flavor syntax design (how to represent `package[feature,!other]`?)
