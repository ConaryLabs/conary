### Architecture Decisions

**Database-First**
- All state and configuration in SQLite
- No text-based config files
- File-level tracking with hashes for integrity and delta updates

**Conary-Inspired Design**
- Changesets as core primitive (atomic operations)
- Troves as hierarchical package units
- Flavors for build-time variations
- Components for automatic package splitting
- Provenance tracking for supply chain security

**Technology Stack**
- Rust 1.91.1 stable (Edition 2024)
- rusqlite (synchronous SQLite interface)
- File-level granularity for delta updates and rollback

### Next Steps (Phase 5)
**Phase 5: TBD - See ROADMAP.md**
- Dependency resolution system
- Repository management
- Additional package formats (DEB, Arch)
- CLI commands for package operations

### Open Questions
- Delta update implementation strategy (binary diff tools: bsdiff, xdelta3, zstd?)
- Package format parser priority (start with RPM, DEB, or Arch?)
- Flavor syntax design (how to represent `package[feature,!other]`?)

  - `DeltaMetrics` struct tracks sizes, compression ratios, and bandwidth savings
  - `DeltaGenerator` creates deltas using zstd dictionary compression
  - `DeltaApplier` reconstructs new files from old file + delta
  - Delta format: `delta = zstd_compress(new_content, dictionary=old_content)`
  - COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 3 (fast with good compression)
  - MAX_DELTA_RATIO = 0.9 (deltas must be <90% of full size to be worthwhile)
  - Automatic fallback if delta not worthwhile
  - Full integration with existing CAS infrastructure
  - 6 comprehensive unit tests including hash mismatch detection

Part 2 - Database Schema v5:

    - Unique index on (package_name, from_version, to_version)
  - `delta_stats`: bandwidth metrics per changeset

  - Automatic compression_ratio calculation
  - Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Added DeltaStats model to src/db/models.rs (84 lines):

Part 5 - Update Command Implementation:
- Replaced stub Update command with full delta-first implementation (220+ lines):
  - Checks for updates across all installed packages or specific package
  - Delta-first logic: tries delta before falling back to full download
  - For each update:
    1. Query database for available delta (from current → new version)
    2. If delta exists: download, apply, verify hash
    3. If delta fails/unavailable: fall back to full package download
  - Tracks detailed statistics (bytes saved, success/failure rates)
  - Creates changeset for update transaction
  - Stores DeltaStats in database for metrics
  - Prints comprehensive summary with bandwidth savings

Part 6 - Delta Statistics CLI:

  - Build SelectionOptions from CLI flags
  - PackageSelector::find_best_package() for repository search
  - Download to temp directory with TempDir
  - Continue with existing installation logic
- Auto-upgrade logic:

  - If newer: upgrade (remove old, install new)
  - If same: error (already installed)
  - If older: error (cannot downgrade)
  - Changeset description shows "Upgrade X from Y to Z"

Part 3 - Complete Update Command:

    - Skips rpmlib() and file path dependencies
    - Checks if already installed
    - Returns list of dependencies to download with PackageWithRepo
    - Errors if required dependency not found in any repository
  - `download_dependencies()` - downloads all dependencies to directory
    - Returns list of (dep_name, downloaded_path) tuples
- Integrated into Install command (lines 519-576):

  - Call resolve_dependencies() to find missing deps
  - Download all missing dependencies
  - Install each dependency using install_package_from_file()
  - Sequential installation (can parallelize later)
  - Clear error messages for dependency resolution failures

Key Implementation Decisions:
1. Simple depth-first dependency resolution (one level, no recursion yet)
2. Sequential dependency installation (parallel can be added later)
3. Helper function install_package_from_file() for code reuse
4. Architecture filtering uses system architecture by default
5. Dry-run implementation stops before database transaction
6. Update command reuses install helper for consistency

Known Limitations (Session 13):
- Dependencies resolved one level only (transitive deps not yet recursive) [FIXED in Session 14]
- No parallel downloads yet (sequential is simpler and safer) [FIXED in Session 14]

  - package.to_trove()
- Format detection already supported all three formats:
  - Extension-based: .rpm, .deb, .pkg.tar.{zst,xz}
  - Magic byte fallback for each format

Part 5 - Testing and Quality:
- All 98 tests passing
- New test coverage:
  - ArchPackage: 5 unit tests (structure, trait, compression, parsing, deps)
  - DebPackage: 5 unit tests (structure, trait, control, dep parsing)
- Existing RPM tests unchanged and passing
- Zero compilation warnings (after fixing unused imports)
- Build time: ~4.5 seconds for full build
- Test execution: 1.5 seconds for all 98 tests

Part 6 - File Structure:
Files created:
- src/packages/arch.rs (470 lines)
  - ArchPackage struct and PackageFormat impl
  - CompressionFormat enum (Zstd, Xz, Gzip)
  - PkgInfo struct for .PKGINFO parsing
  - Helper methods for parsing and extraction
- src/packages/deb.rs (550 lines)
  - DebPackage struct and PackageFormat impl
  - ControlInfo struct for control file parsing
  - Helper methods for AR extraction and parsing

Files modified:
- src/packages/mod.rs: Added arch and deb modules
- src/packages/traits.rs:
  - Added extract_file_contents() to PackageFormat trait
  - Added description field to Dependency
  - Made DependencyType Copy
- src/packages/rpm.rs:
  - Moved extract_file_contents() to trait impl
  - Added description: None to Dependency creation
- src/main.rs:
  - Added ArchPackage and DebPackage imports
  - Changed install_package_from_file() to use Box<dyn PackageFormat>
  - Updated all rpm variable references to package
- Cargo.toml: Added ar = "0.9" dependency

Part 7 - Implementation Highlights:
- Trait-based abstraction with dynamic dispatch
- Zero runtime overhead for method calls (trait objects use vtables)
- Content-addressable storage works uniformly across formats
- SHA-256 computed during extraction for all formats
- File metadata (path, size, mode, hash) consistent structure
- Dependency resolution will work across package formats
- Installation path identical for RPM, DEB, and Arch packages

Part 8 - Dependency Handling Consistency:
- All formats map to three types: Runtime, Build, Optional
- Version constraints preserved in original format:
  - RPM: "glibc >= 2.34-1" (space-separated)
  - Arch: "glibc>=2.34" (no spaces)
  - Debian: "libc6 (>= 2.34)" (parenthesized)
- Resolver will need format-specific constraint parsing
- Optional dependencies preserve descriptions where available

Multi-Format Installation Success Criteria Met:
- PackageFormat trait extended with extract_file_contents() (checkmark)
- ArchPackage fully implemented and tested (checkmark)
- DebPackage fully implemented and tested (checkmark)
- Dynamic dispatch working in install path (checkmark)
- All three formats installable (checkmark)
- All 98 tests passing (checkmark)
- Zero compilation warnings (checkmark)

Technical Achievements:
- Single code path handles RPM, DEB, and Arch packages
- Polymorphic file extraction and metadata access
- Dependency information preserved across formats
- Content-addressable storage format-agnostic
- Installation transaction logic unchanged
- File conflict detection works uniformly

Format-Specific Details Preserved:
- RPM: source_rpm, build_host, vendor, license, url
- Arch: licenses (array), groups, packager, build_date, url
- Debian: maintainer, section, priority, homepage, installed_size
- Accessible via format-specific methods on concrete types
- Lost after conversion to Box<dyn PackageFormat> (design trade-off)

Known Limitations (Session 17):
- Format-specific metadata not accessible through trait
- Dependency version constraint formats not normalized
- No verification of package signatures yet
- File permissions not validated during installation
- Symlinks not yet handled in any format
- No support for package scripts (pre/post install)
