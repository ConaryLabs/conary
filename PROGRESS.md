- All tests passing (6 unit + integration tests)
- Rust Edition 2024, rust-version 1.90 (system version)

### Phase 2 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- Complete SQLite schema (src/db/schema.rs) with 6 core tables:
  - `troves` - package/component/collection metadata with UNIQUE constraints
  - `changesets` - transactional operation history with status tracking
  - `files` - file-level tracking with SHA-256 hashes and foreign keys
  - `flavors` - build-time variations (key-value pairs per trove)
  - `provenance` - supply chain tracking (source, commit, builder)
  - `dependencies` - trove relationships with version constraints
- Schema migration system with version tracking (currently v1)
- Data models (src/db/models.rs) with full CRUD operations:
  - `Trove` with `TroveType` enum (Package, Component, Collection)
  - `Changeset` with `ChangesetStatus` enum (Pending, Applied, RolledBack)
  - `FileEntry` with permissions, ownership, and hash tracking
- Transaction wrapper for atomic operations with automatic commit/rollback
- Proper `FromStr` trait implementations for type safety
- Comprehensive test suite: 17 tests passing (12 unit + 5 integration)
- Cascade delete support (files deleted when trove is deleted)
- All code clippy-clean with zero warnings

### Phase 3 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- Completed remaining core data models (src/db/models.rs):
  - `Flavor` model with full CRUD operations (insert, find_by_trove, find_by_key, delete)
  - `Provenance` model with full CRUD operations (insert, find_by_trove, update, delete)
- Build-time variation tracking via flavors (key-value pairs)
- Supply chain tracking via provenance (source URL, branch, commit, builder, build host)
- Unit tests for Flavor CRUD (4 tests including cascade delete)
- Unit tests for Provenance CRUD (2 tests including cascade delete)
- Integration test demonstrating troves with flavors and provenance together
- Full test suite: 22 tests passing (16 unit + 6 integration)
- All models support cascade delete when parent trove is removed
- Clippy-clean with zero warnings

### Phase 4 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- RPM package format parser implementation (src/packages/):
  - Created packages module structure (mod.rs, traits.rs, rpm.rs)
  - `PackageFormat` trait for cross-format abstraction
  - `RpmPackage` implementation with rpm crate (v0.14)
  - Full file extraction with metadata (path, size, mode, SHA digest)
  - Dependency extraction (runtime dependencies from Requires)
  - Provenance metadata extraction (source_rpm, build_host, vendor, license, url)
- CLI import command (conary import <rpm-file>):
  - Parse RPM package and extract all metadata
  - Convert to Trove and insert into database
  - Display package summary with provenance info
- Comprehensive test suite:
  - 6 unit tests for RPM package structure and trait implementations
  - Integration test for RPM import workflow (marked as ignored, requires real RPM)
  - Full test suite: 28 tests passing (22 unit + 6 integration, 1 ignored)
- All code clippy-clean with zero warnings
- Ready for package imports via CLI

### Architecture Decisions

**Database-First**
- All state and configuration in SQLite
- No text-based config files
- File-level tracking with hashes for integrity and delta updates

**Conary-Inspired Design**
- Changesets as core primitive (atomic operations)
- Troves as hierarchical package units
- Flavors for build-time variations
- Components for automatic package splitting
- Provenance tracking for supply chain security

**Technology Stack**
- Rust 1.91.1 stable (Edition 2024)
- rusqlite (synchronous SQLite interface)
- File-level granularity for delta updates and rollback

### Next Steps (Phase 5)
**Phase 5: TBD - See ROADMAP.md**
- Dependency resolution system
- Repository management
- Additional package formats (DEB, Arch)
- CLI commands for package operations

### Open Questions
- Delta update implementation strategy (binary diff tools: bsdiff, xdelta3, zstd?)
- Package format parser priority (start with RPM, DEB, or Arch?)
- Flavor syntax design (how to represent `package[feature,!other]`?)

**Session 7** (2025-11-14) - **Phase 5 Complete: Changeset Transaction Model**

Part 1 - Core Changeset Operations:
- Implemented Remove command (conary remove <package>):
  - Finds installed package by name
  - Creates removal changeset
  - Deletes trove and files within transaction
  - Marks changeset as Applied
- Implemented Query command (conary query [pattern]):
  - Lists all installed packages
  - Optional pattern matching by package name
  - Shows package name, version, type, and architecture
- Implemented History command (conary history):
  - Shows all changesets with status
  - Displays timestamp, description, and status
  - Ordered by creation time
- Enhanced Changeset model for rollback tracking:
  - Added reversed_by_changeset_id field
  - Created schema migration v2 for the new column
  - Updated all Changeset methods to handle rollback tracking
- Implemented Rollback command (conary rollback <changeset-id>):
  - Validates changeset can be rolled back
  - Reverses Install operations by deleting troves
  - Creates new changeset for rollback operation
  - Marks original changeset as RolledBack
  - Links rollback changeset via reversed_by_changeset_id
  - Note: Cannot rollback Remove operations yet (requires data preservation)

Part 2 - Validation and Testing:
- Added pre-transaction validation for install:
  - Checks if package (name+version+arch) already installed
  - Returns clear error preventing duplicate installations
- Existing remove validation verified:
  - Checks package exists before removal
  - Handles multiple versions appropriately
- Comprehensive integration test suite:
  - test_install_and_remove_workflow - Full install/remove cycle
  - test_install_and_rollback - Install and rollback verification
  - test_query_packages - Multi-package query testing
  - test_history_shows_operations - Changeset history tracking
- Final testing:
  - 39 tests passing (29 unit + 10 integration, 1 ignored)
  - All code clippy-clean with zero warnings
  - Schema migration v2 tested and working

Phase 5 Success Criteria Met:
- Atomic operations with rollback capability ✓
- Pre-transaction validation ✓
- File conflict detection (database level) ✓
- Transaction logging and history ✓
- Comprehensive tests ✓
