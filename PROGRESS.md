## Project Status: Phase 4 Complete - RPM Package Format Support

### Current State
- [COMPLETE] **Phase 0**: Vision and architecture documented
- [COMPLETE] **Phase 1**: Foundation & Project Setup complete
- [COMPLETE] **Phase 2**: Database Schema & Core Layer complete
- [COMPLETE] **Phase 3**: Core Abstractions & Data Models complete
- [COMPLETE] **Phase 4**: Package Format Support (RPM parser)
- [PENDING] **Phase 5**: Next phase TBD

### Phase 1 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- Cargo.toml with core dependencies (rusqlite, thiserror, anyhow, clap, sha2, tracing)
- Project structure: src/main.rs, src/lib.rs, src/db/mod.rs, src/error.rs
- Database connection management (init, open) with SQLite pragmas (WAL, foreign keys)
- Basic CLI skeleton with help/version and `init` command
- Integration test framework in tests/
- CI configuration (GitHub Actions: test, clippy, rustfmt, security audit)
- All tests passing (6 unit + integration tests)
- Rust Edition 2024, rust-version 1.90 (system version)

### Phase 2 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- Complete SQLite schema (src/db/schema.rs) with 6 core tables:
  - `troves` - package/component/collection metadata with UNIQUE constraints
  - `changesets` - transactional operation history with status tracking
  - `files` - file-level tracking with SHA-256 hashes and foreign keys
  - `flavors` - build-time variations (key-value pairs per trove)
  - `provenance` - supply chain tracking (source, commit, builder)
  - `dependencies` - trove relationships with version constraints
- Schema migration system with version tracking (currently v1)
- Data models (src/db/models.rs) with full CRUD operations:
  - `Trove` with `TroveType` enum (Package, Component, Collection)
  - `Changeset` with `ChangesetStatus` enum (Pending, Applied, RolledBack)
  - `FileEntry` with permissions, ownership, and hash tracking
- Transaction wrapper for atomic operations with automatic commit/rollback
- Proper `FromStr` trait implementations for type safety
- Comprehensive test suite: 17 tests passing (12 unit + 5 integration)
- Cascade delete support (files deleted when trove is deleted)
- All code clippy-clean with zero warnings

### Phase 3 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- Completed remaining core data models (src/db/models.rs):
  - `Flavor` model with full CRUD operations (insert, find_by_trove, find_by_key, delete)
  - `Provenance` model with full CRUD operations (insert, find_by_trove, update, delete)
- Build-time variation tracking via flavors (key-value pairs)
- Supply chain tracking via provenance (source URL, branch, commit, builder, build host)
- Unit tests for Flavor CRUD (4 tests including cascade delete)
- Unit tests for Provenance CRUD (2 tests including cascade delete)
- Integration test demonstrating troves with flavors and provenance together
- Full test suite: 22 tests passing (16 unit + 6 integration)
- All models support cascade delete when parent trove is removed
- Clippy-clean with zero warnings

### Phase 4 Deliverables [COMPLETE]
- RPM package format parser implementation (src/packages/):
  - Created packages module structure (mod.rs, traits.rs, rpm.rs)
  - `PackageFormat` trait for cross-format abstraction
  - `RpmPackage` implementation with rpm crate (v0.14)
  - Full file extraction with metadata (path, size, mode, SHA digest)
  - Dependency extraction (runtime dependencies from Requires)
  - Provenance metadata extraction (source_rpm, build_host, vendor, license, url)
- CLI import command (conary import <rpm-file>):
  - Parse RPM package and extract all metadata
  - Convert to Trove and insert into database
  - Display package summary with provenance info
- Comprehensive test suite:
  - 6 unit tests for RPM package structure and trait implementations
  - Integration test for RPM import workflow (marked as ignored, requires real RPM)
  - Full test suite: 28 tests passing (22 unit + 6 integration, 1 ignored)
- All code clippy-clean with zero warnings
- Ready for package imports via CLI

### Architecture Decisions

**Database-First**
- All state and configuration in SQLite
- No text-based config files
- File-level tracking with hashes for integrity and delta updates

**Conary-Inspired Design**
- Changesets as core primitive (atomic operations)
- Troves as hierarchical package units
- Flavors for build-time variations
- Components for automatic package splitting
- Provenance tracking for supply chain security

**Technology Stack**
- Rust 1.91.1 stable (Edition 2024)
- rusqlite (synchronous SQLite interface)
- File-level granularity for delta updates and rollback

### Next Steps (Phase 5)
**Phase 5: TBD - See ROADMAP.md**
- Dependency resolution system
- Repository management
- Additional package formats (DEB, Arch)
- CLI commands for package operations

### Open Questions
- Delta update implementation strategy (binary diff tools: bsdiff, xdelta3, zstd?)
- Package format parser priority (start with RPM, DEB, or Arch?)
- Flavor syntax design (how to represent `package[feature,!other]`?)

### Session Log
