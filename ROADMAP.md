# Conary Package Manager - Phased Roadmap

## Current State
**Phase 6 Complete** - Foundation is solid with 47 tests passing. Core package management functionality is working: install, remove, rollback, verify, and query operations all functional with full filesystem deployment and atomic transactions.

**Completed:** Phases 0-6 (Database, schema, core models, RPM support, changeset transactions, file operations with CAS)
**Next:** Phase 7 (Dependency Resolution) and beyond

See PROGRESS.md for detailed session-by-session implementation notes.

---

## Phase 0: Project Bootstrap ✓ (COMPLETE)
- Vision and architecture documentation
- Core concepts finalized (troves, changesets, flavors)
- Technology stack decided (Rust 1.91.1, SQLite)

- Progress tracking framework (PROGRESS.md)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup ✓ (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Get a minimal Rust project running with database connectivity

**Deliverables**:

- File header conventions in place
- Database connection management
- Basic CLI skeleton (just help/version)
- Integration test framework setup
- CI configuration (cargo test, clippy, rustfmt checks)

**Success Criteria**: `cargo build` works, can open/close SQLite database

---

## Phase 2: Database Schema & Core Layer ✓ (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Design and implement the foundational database schema

**Deliverables**:
- SQLite schema with core tables:
  - `troves` - package/component/collection metadata
  - `changesets` - transactional operations history
  - `files` - file-level tracking with hashes
  - `flavors` - build-time variations
  - `provenance` - supply chain tracking
  - `dependencies` - trove relationships
- Schema migration system
- Database initialization logic
- CRUD operations for core entities
- Transaction wrapper utilities
- Comprehensive database tests

**Success Criteria**: Can create database, run migrations, perform basic CRUD operations

---

## Phase 3: Core Abstractions & Data Models ✓ (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Build the Rust types and abstractions that represent core concepts

**Deliverables**:
- `Trove` struct with variants (Package, Component, Collection)

- Pre-transaction validation (dependency checks, conflict detection)
- Atomic application of changesets
- Rollback mechanism (restore previous state)
- File conflict detection and resolution
- Transaction logging and history

## Phase 6: File-Level Operations ✓ (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Implement file installation, tracking, and integrity checking

**Deliverables**:
- File extraction and installation
- SHA-256 hashing for all installed files
- File ownership and permissions handling

- Conflict detection (version incompatibilities)
- Optional dependency handling
- Circular dependency detection
- "What breaks if I remove X?" queries
- Efficient SQLite queries for dep resolution

**Success Criteria**: Can resolve dependencies for complex package installations

---

## Phase 8: CLI Interface (Basic Commands) - ✓ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Build user-facing command-line interface

**Deliverables**:
- ✓ `conary install <trove>` - install packages (DONE in Phase 4-6)
- ✓ `conary remove <trove>` - remove packages with dependency checking (DONE in Phase 5+7)
- ✓ `conary rollback <changeset-id>` - rollback to previous state (DONE in Phase 5-6)
- ✓ `conary query <pattern>` - search installed packages (DONE in Phase 5)
- ✓ `conary verify [package]` - check file integrity (DONE in Phase 6)
- ✓ `conary history` - show changeset history (DONE in Phase 5)
- ✓ `conary depends <package>` - show dependencies (DONE in Phase 7)
- ✓ `conary rdepends <package>` - show reverse dependencies (DONE in Phase 7)
- ✓ `conary whatbreaks <package>` - show breaking packages (DONE in Phase 7)
- ✓ `conary completions <shell>` - generate shell completions (DONE in Phase 8)
- ✓ Shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, powershell (DONE in Phase 8)
- ✓ Man pages via clap_mangen (DONE in Phase 8)

---

## Decision Points

**Resolved:**
1. ✓ **Phase 4**: RPM chosen as first format (implemented)

3. ✓ **Logging**: `tracing` with `tracing-subscriber` (implemented)
4. ✓ **CLI**: `clap` v4.5 with derive macros (implemented)

**To Be Decided:**
1. **Phase 9**: Which delta algorithm to use? (Recommendation: zstd)
2. **Phase 10**: Order for additional formats (DEB vs Arch next?)

---

## Notes

- Each phase should update PROGRESS.md upon completion
- Tests are mandatory at every phase
- Database schema changes require migration scripts
- Keep dependency tree lean throughout
- Review and refine roadmap as we learn
- All code must follow standards in CLAUDE.md
- Database-first architecture: NO config files for runtime state
